## Implementation Details (./server)

### 1. Database Setup Dirzzle: PostgreSQL with Neon Server

- Setup the neon project and copy `Connection string` from dashboard as a serverless database provide
  - create .env and set DATABASE_URL=Connection string
- Drizzle with Neon Postgres docs(https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/tutorials/drizzle-with-neon)
- Verify by migrating to db

_Note: **db** connection should be in `./server/index.ts` where as **schema** should be in `./server/schema.ts`_

### 2. Next-Auth.js (with Drizzle)

- Setup as instructed in docs: (https://authjs.dev/getting-started/adapters/drizzle)
  - Only copy the **users**, and **accounts** schemas. Don't copy all as it contains db connection code as well, which we've already done in `./index.ts`
- Add the neccessary **Providers[]** for `./auth.ts`, such as Google, Github and so on according to need.
  1. Get the GITHUB_ID and GITHUB_SECRET key from the `github/setting/developer-setting/oath-apps` and get the **client_id** and **client_secret** from there.
  2. Get the GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
     - get into `https://console.cloud.google.com/`
     - create new project
     - get into dashboard
     - get to the **APIs and Services**
     - go to Credentials and create `OAuth Client ID`
     - Once created, again to to the Credentials and select `OAuth Cliet ID`, which now will give you application type options: pick **web**
       - Now set up
         - **Authorized JS origins** --> `http://localhost:3000`
         - **Authorized redirect URIs** --> `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
  - Now copy the given Client ID and Secret key

_Note: Don't forget to add AUTH_SECRET in `./server/auth.ts` by doing `npx auth || secret` as handlers requires it and add **session.strategy: 'jwt'** for not defaulting to session schema_

### 3. Upload Thing Image Upload

- For changing profile pic | avatar image

### 4. Product with TipTap (Rich Text Editor)

- For Rich Text Editor to add description

### 5. Product List with TanStack Table

- For listing product in table with search filter and paginations

### 6. Model Relation for Product, productVariant, variantImages, variantTags

- Relation established with one to one and one to many on models

re! Here's a detailed README.md section for the InputTags component in Markdown format:

### 7. InputTags Component Implementation Details

The `InputTags` component is used to manage a list of tags that can be added and removed dynamically. This implementation uses React hooks and animation for smooth transitions and a user-friendly experience.

1. **Tag Management**

   - Allows users to add tags by typing and pressing "Enter".
   - Tags can be removed by clicking the "X" button next to each tag.

2. **Dynamic Tag List**

   - The tags are stored as an array of strings and displayed as badges.
   - The list updates dynamically when tags are added or removed.

3. **State Management**

   - Uses `useState` to track the current input (`pendingDataPoint`) and whether the input field is focused (`focused`).
   - The `value` prop is passed from the parent component, and the `onChange` function is used to update the list of tags.

4. **Focus Management**

   - The component sets focus on the input field when clicked using `useFormContext`'s `setFocus` method from `react-hook-form`.

5. **Smooth Animations**

   - Animations are handled with the `motion.div` from `motion/react` to provide a smooth enter and exit transition when adding or removing tags.

6. **Input Field Behavior**

   - On pressing "Enter", the current value is added as a new tag if it is non-empty.
   - On pressing "Backspace" when the input field is empty, the last tag in the list is removed.

7. **Customizable Props**

   - The component accepts all `InputProps` from the `Input` component, including any styling or custom properties.

8. **Styling**

   - The component is styled using utility classes from Tailwind CSS, allowing for flexibility in layout and appearance.

9. **Reusability**

   - This component is highly reusable across different forms or interfaces requiring tag input.

10. **Error Handling**
    - The component can handle form validation errors seamlessly as part of the parent form's validation.

### 8. Product Variant Implementation Details

1. **Form Handling**

   - Managed using `react-hook-form` with `zodResolver` for robust form validation and state management.

2. **Dynamic Initialization**

   - The form fields are pre-populated dynamically in `editMode` using incoming variant props.

3. **UI Components**

   - Built with reusable components like `Dialog`, `FormField`, `Input`, and `Button` for consistent styling and functionality.

4. **Custom Inputs**

   - Includes `InputTags` for managing tags and `VariantImages` for handling variant images.

5. **Data Mapping**

   - Maps `variantTags` and `variantImages` from the incoming data to form fields for seamless editing.

6. **Server-Side Actions**

   - Integrated server actions (`createVariant`, `deleteVariant`) to handle backend operations securely.

7. **Real-Time Feedback**

   - Provides user feedback with `sonner` toasts for success, error, and execution states.

8. **State Management**

   - Dialog visibility and `editMode` logic controlled using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.

9. **Customization**

   - Includes fields for variant title, color picker, tags, and images to allow flexible configurations.

10. **Validation and Messages**
    - Ensures data accuracy with validation rules and displays errors or status updates using `FormMessage`.

### 9. Stripe Implementationa

1. Sign up to stripe account and get the **public** and **secret** keys and store in **.evn** file

2. Install 3 different packages:

   ```
   npm i @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js stripe

   ```

3. Create a lib/get-stirpe.ts and export Stripe using **public** key for initialization on need

4. Create **Payment** Component using **Elements** from **_@stripe/react-stripe-js_** which takes the exported **stripe** init and its **options**: **_mode, currency, amount_** for payment.

5. Create **PaymentForm** Component For **Elements** wrapper. Once, **Element** wrapper is covered, **PaymentForm** now can use various hooks to work with stripe.

   > **Hooks:** from **_@stripe/react-stripe-js_**

   - **stripe** from **useStripe()**
   - **elements** from **useElements()**
   - **cart** from zustand **useCartStore()**

   > Modules from **_@stripe/react-stripe-js_**

   - **PaymentElment** | **AddressElement** for form

   - Create `<form>` with **PaymentElment** | **AddressElement**, address takes **options** **_{mode: shipping | billing}_**

6. Create **PaymentIntent**, when User wants to pay for something stripe requires paymentintent which passess amount and product metadata. Though there are alternate to paymentintent, aka server action and send the response to client using created **paymentIntent** such as **_paymentIntentId, clientSecretId, and user.email as metadata_**.

7. **Webhook** for stripe payment success and trigger `api/stripe/route.ts`

   - install stripe cli and configure
     - window: download cli zip, extract and add file to env path to system
   - follow:

     > stripe login

     > authenticate to stripe.com and add the webhook secret to .env file

     > stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe

   - Create **api/stripe/route.ts** and copty the code from codebase for POST method to update the order table in db to add succeeded status and receipt url
